=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Crypt::Random::Source::Strong::openssl;

	my $source = Crypt::Random::Source::Weak::openssl->new

	my $bytes = $source->get(1024); # get 1kb of random bytes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a B<weak> random byte source because C<openssl rand> is a PRNG.

This is a subclass of L<Crypt::Random::Source::Base::Proc>.

Due to the retarded nature of the F<rand> command line utility's interface, it
must repeatedly be invoked with C<default_chunk_size> as number of random bytes
to generate.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item default_chunk_size

The default number of bytes to generate per C<openssl rand> invocation.

Defaults to 64 kb, which is pretty large and balances well with the startup
time of C<openssl rand> for miniscule chunks.

If you will be needing a lot of random data, increasing this number to
something much larger would probably be beneficial.

=item openssl

The C<openssl> executable to invoke. Defaults to what L<File::Which> found for
C<openssl> (which means it must be in your C<PATH>).
